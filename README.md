// My Weather App on NextJS

// I built a weather app allocationg data fetched from openweatherapp.org to show current and forecasted weather in cities around world

// You can search by City or City, Country (ex. New York, US), or zip code, country (ex. 12345, AB)

// Comment Addressed: I gave the site a random default location of Yakutsk, RU in case user doesn't give their geo coordinates (JP 03.29.2024 4 pm)

// Peer Review: Looking at the website, I like the design of it, it's simple and easy on the eyes, and also is mobile responsive. I also love how the background changes, based off of the time of the city, I think that's very clever. I also like how you are able to search by city and and zip code. One thing that I do notice is that when I don't allow my location, it's basically a blank template page, I reccommend having a default city or loaction just in case they don't allow geolocation. Upon looking at the code, I don't know where to even start, I really like how organized his file structure with all his components, I like how he created an object with a bunch of keys to be able to return his weather icons, I really like how he used the leverage the date object to create an actual clock and get the time, etc. Overall, Great Job!!!
